Things to consider (in order):
- Accuracy of moves
- Secondary effects of moves
- Stat modifiers
- Status effects
- Proper Switching after death (need some sort of sub-node)
- 
- Have code to learn about 
- Entry Hazards & Weather Effects (this will likely require a Battle object)
- Mean Look / Sticky Web / other things precluding switching
